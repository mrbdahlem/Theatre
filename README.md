# The Theater
This project takes the [Code.org](https://code.org) Theatre
and breaks it free of the Java Lab so that you can use it in
the local IDE as you prefer.

## What can I do with The Theater?
In Unit 4 of the Code.org AP CSA curriculum, students are
introduced to The Theater and explore its components and
functionality. Students use the classes and methods provided
by the Theater to play sounds, create drawings, and show
images. 

This version of the Theater takes that ability and brings
it to your local computer so that you can more easily integrate
version control, asset files, and the use of a professional or
educational IDE as you choose.

## How can I use it?
The ```theatre-_VERSION_NUMER_.jar``` file in the [Packages](https://github.com/users/mrbdahlem/packages?repo_name=Theatre)
page for this project can be added as a library in a project
in your IDE to give you the full functionality provided by
the Code.org Theater in Java Lab, but running as a local
program on your computer. Projects that you create can be
packaged up as .jar files themselves and become executable
by themselves on any computer with a JRE installed.

You can also clone one of the following repositories and
checkout the code in your IDE to start right off:
* [BlueJ](https://github.com/mrbdahlem/BlueJTheater)
* [Eclipse](https://github.com/mrbdahlem/EclipseTheater)
* [IntelliJ](https://github.com/mrbdahlem/IntelliJTheater)
* [NetBeans](https://github.com/mrbdahlem/NetbeansTheater)

## Where can I get documentation for the Theater?
[Code.org](https://code.org) provides some wonderful 
[documentation](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Theater)
for use with Java Lab.
